# Welcome to my first React Native app
### About the project:

To build this application we used this [design](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbnZxbEhIbHVETEdiVGc3dUQtWG5SYzFzTHZWd3xBQ3Jtc0tuT00xY0pkTXlTaEh5bTVZc1pmTmd0RVlVaUpxYVFnSV9iekJ0S2tYeFFQUmxTamh3UUFHcWtpRFNxbTNPal8yRDFiMWwydS0wakJtVWRYS29iWVhlNWxzU291MUFXRF9qZXNZelNGcEFGcjUyNTRlTQ&q=https://dribbble.com/shots/11867493-Job-finder-Mobile-UI-Job-list&v=mJ3bGvy0WAY) to inspire the layout of the application, to search for jobs we used the JSearch API.
